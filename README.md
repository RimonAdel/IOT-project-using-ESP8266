# IOT-project-using-ESP8266
A simple IOT project in interfacing with ESP8266, it consists of 2 parts, first one in case both the server and ESP client is connected to the same network so an UDP peer discovery is done first then a TCP connection is established, in the other case of different networks for both server and ESP client, the client keep pending waiting for a TCP handshaking connection to be made to start data streaming.
